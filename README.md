# G.B. Marketplace

## Overview

G.B. Marketplace is a marketplace app that supports the buying and selling of
goods within the local community. Users can create accounts which let them manage
their listings, wishlists and allows them to text each other for better communication.
A user can be either a seller or a buyer. As a seller, they will be able to post
items they want to sell, and as a buyer, they can browse through the listings for
items that they might be interested in. After transactions, people can also rate
each other and review their experience. More description to be added.
